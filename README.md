# RS-M3Bench: A Multi-Granularity, Multi-Task, Multi-Resolution Benchmark for Scalable Evaluation of Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models
RS-M3Bench is the first unified benchmark for multi-granularity, multi-task, multi-resolution evaluation of RS-VLMs, shattering the limitations of existing frameworks. By integrating pixel-precise masks (from SATLAS-pretrain), richly structured scene graphs (from STAR and ReCon1M with 120+ subcategories), and multi-resolution imagery (800×800 – 10,000×10,000 pixels), RS-M3Bench delivers 6.5M annotations—surpassing all current benchmarks combined—enabling exhaustive assessment across 13 tasks, from fine-grained segmentation to large-scale VQA. Unlike prior works, our benchmark forces models to demonstrate true geospatial reasoning, with GPT-4V generations and SAM-enhanced masks ensuring pixel-level accuracy and scene-level context coexist. Experiments reveal stark capability gaps in cutting- edge RS-VLMs and general-purpose VLMs, proving existing VLMs systematically overestimate real-world readiness. RS-M3Bench establishes a solid foundation for scalable, rigorous, and actionable RS-VLM benchmarking.
